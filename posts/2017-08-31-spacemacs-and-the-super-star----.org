Spacemacs supports the Vim super star functionality to search for the current
word. When you press "*", it shows a small menu in the minibuffer called "Symbol
Highlight Transient State". This menu offers some standard key bindings to jump
to the next and previous occurrence of the word, but also some that made me go
"Wow!":

r to switch between searching for the visual buffer or the whole file
b to search all the buffers
f to search a directory of your choosing using helm-ag
/ to search the whole project using helm-ag

It just works out of the box.
