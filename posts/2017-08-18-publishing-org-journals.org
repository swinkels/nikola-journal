I would like to export my Org journal files on [[http://blog.journalthatcounts.nl][my blog]].

My blog is generated using the static website generator Nikola. Although Nikola
supports Org files, I cannot just feed it the journal files as-is. For example,
Nikola requires specific meta information about each blog entry, which a journal
entry does not have. However, that is just a minor technical hurdle - we could
automatically extract the meta information from each entry.

Another thing is that I do not want to give journal entries the same "status" as
blog posts. For example, I want blog posts and journal entries to appear on
separate pages, to exclude journal updates from the RSS feeds. This means that I
cannot use Nikola /categories/ or /sections/ to distinguish posts. At least, not
without some custom changes to Nikola.

Because I want my export my journal as soon as possible, I will export them to
HTML using the Org mode publishing capabilities. This export will be accessible
from the blog through a new top-level tab, e.g. "Journal".
