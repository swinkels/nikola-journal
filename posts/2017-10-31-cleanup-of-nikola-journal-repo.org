I cleaned up my [[https://github.com/swinkels/nikola-journal][nikola-journal]] repo a bit. First I removed the files from the
repo that are generated by Nikola itself. Initially I put them in the repo so I
would always have the site even when I cannot generate it (anymore). However, it
does add quite a number of files to repo and furthermore, it does not feel right
to use the repo to back up the site.

I also added a proper README, in orgmode format, instead of the one that was
generated by Nikola when I created the site.
