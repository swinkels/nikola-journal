* Watching Derek Wyatt's VIM tutorial

The last week or so I have been looking into Spacemacs and the Vim editing style
you can use it with. I only knew a few things about Vim so I have been reading
up on it.

Yesterday I came across the [[http://derekwyatt.org/vim/tutorials/index.html][Vim tutorial]] by Derek Wyatt and just watched the
first episodes on basic cursor movement. Part of the information I had already
read in other tutorials - hey, it was about basic cursor movement - but
definately not everything.

I liked how he emphasized that to become productive in Vim, you would need to
learn to move the cursor "the Vim way", so without cursor keys or worse, the
mouse. He has an energetic and engaging teaching style and I am looking forward
to the next episodes.
