The previous journal entry ended with the idea that we can just
pass in TSTART and TEND as seconds. So we try that:
(defun my-org-clock-sum-current-item ()
  "Return time, clocked on current item in total."
  (save-excursion
    (save-restriction
      (org-narrow-to-subtree)
      (let ((tstart "2017-08-09") (tend "2017-08-10"))
        (org-clock-sum
         (org-time-string-to-seconds tstart)
         (org-time-string-to-seconds tend))))))

(org-map-entries 'my-org-clock-sum-current-item "emacs" 'agenda)
#+END_SRC
And it works!
