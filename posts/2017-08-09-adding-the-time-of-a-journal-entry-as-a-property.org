   :PROPERTIES:
   :Time:     16:01
   :END:
By default org-journal prepends each title of a journal entry with time the
entry was started. For example, the current entry was originally titled
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
16:01 Add the time of a journal entry as a property
#+END_EXAMPLE
I prefer to not have the start time in the title. The following snippet takes
care of that:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-journal-time-format "")
#+END_SRC

On the other hand, I do not want to lose that information completely. So I
implemented a hook to automatically enter the time in a property drawer of the
newly created entry:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun add-time-as-orgmode-property()
  (progn
    (org-insert-property-drawer)
    (org-entry-put (point) "Time" (format-time-string "%H:%M"))
    (re-search-backward "^*")
    (end-of-line)
    )
)

(add-hook 'org-journal-after-entry-create-hook 'add-time-as-orgmode-property)
#+END_SRC
With this change, the current entry starts as follows
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Add the time of a journal entry as a property
:PROPERTIES:
:Time:     16:01
:END:
#+END_EXAMPLE
Note that I left out the '*' symbols that start the heading. If I add them,
org-mode takes that for an actual heading, even if it is inside an example.
