* Programmatically extract information from a org-journal entry

In an earlier journal entry I mentioned that I wanted to export the entries to
HTML and use that HTML directly in my [[blog.journeythatcounts.nl][blog]]. However I found the functionality to
export the entries to a site, which is called "publishing", too limited for my
use case. For example, the export does not seem to support the creation of a
"tag cloud" for the tags of each entry.

sitemap and an index.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my-extract()
    "Return time, clocked on current item in total."
    (save-excursion
      (save-restriction
        (org-narrow-to-subtree)
        (let ((tstart "2017-08-09") (tend "2017-08-10"))
          (org-clock-sum
           (org-time-string-to-seconds tstart)
           (org-time-string-to-seconds tend))))))

  (org-map-entries 'my-extract nil nil)
#+END_SRC
