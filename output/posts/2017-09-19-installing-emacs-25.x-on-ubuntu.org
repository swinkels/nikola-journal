* Installing Emacs 25.x on Ubuntu

Currently I am running Ubuntu 16.04, which comes with Emacs 24.5.1, an Emacs
version from April 2015. The latest version of Emacs version is 25.3, which was
just released last week. Because I was seeing some graphical glitches in 24.5,
for example with relative line numbering in Spacemacs, I wanted to try that
latest release.

Fortunately Kevin Kelley has been so kind to provide a [[https://launchpad.net/~kelleyk/+archive/ubuntu/emacs][PPA for Emacs 25]] packages
for all current Ubuntu releases. It even contains packages for Emacs 25.3. Using
this PPA installation of Emacs 25.3 was a breeze. I installed it side-by-side
with the version of Emacs that comes with Ubuntu.

I wrote this journal entry with Emacs 25.3 and so far, so good.
