* Exporting org-journal entries for use with Nikola

Last week I have been busy writing Emacs Lisp code to export the contents of an
org-journal for use with the static website generator [[https://getnikola.com/][Nikola]]. The goal is to let
each entry become a blog post of the website. I just pushed the first version of
the code to the new GitHub repo [[https://github.com/swinkels/oje][swinkels/oje]], where "oje" stands for
"org-journal exporter".

This first version should be "more or less" functional but still needs work to
be usable by other people than me.
